  '**Access all apprenticeship job opportunities available in France for free and in real-time.** The returned job opportunities are those collected by [La bonne alternance](https://labonnealternance.apprentissage.beta.gouv.fr/) and [its partner sites](https://mission-apprentissage.notion.site/Liste-des-partenaires-de-La-bonne-alternance-3e9aadb0170e41339bac486399ec4ac1?pvs=74).\n\nTwo types of job opportunities are available :\n\n1. Apprenticeship job offers\n2. 2. Companies that have not posted offers but have been identified as "having a high potential for hiring apprentices" through the analysis of various public data (recruitment data, financial data, etc.). This shortlist of companies aims to make the hidden job market more visible and thus facilitate the spontaneous application process for apprenticeship candidates.\n\n**ðŸ’¡ You can search for all job opportunities according to the following criteria: ROME code(s), RNCP, geolocation, diploma level, and search radius.**\n\nThe results are returned by source priority (La bonne alternance then its partners), by increasing distance to the search location if it has been provided as a parameter, and by decreasing creation date.\n\nThe results are limited to 150 per source.\n\nThe use of this API is free and reserved for non-profit uses. Note that any use of this data for commercial purposes, such as reselling or billing access to third parties such as candidates, companies, or schools, is prohibited.\n';
